# Aut(F) is isomorphic to the profinite completion of G, when F: G-Fset -> Fset is the forgetful functor.

Replace `Title` with the title of your project, and *rewrite* this markdown file to describe the following:

1. As the title says, the goal of this project is to show $$Aut(F) \simeq \hat{G}$$ where F is defined like above. 
The relevant background needed is Category Theory, Group Theory, Topology.
We'll need to know the definition of: 
    - the profinite completion, 
    - the automorphism group of a functor (the group of natural isomorphisms under composition)
We'll use the following theorems:
    - the universal property of the profinite completion.
    - Equivalence of categories between G-Fset and \hat{G}-Fset
    - $$Aut(F) \simeq Aut(\hat{F})\simeq \hat{G}$$



We'll use this universal property to create an equivalence of categories between G-Fset and \hat{G}-Fset 

2.
    - Defining the underlying set of profinite completion of a group
    - Putting a Group and Topology instance on it
    - Define the universal property (inclusion map, commutative diagram, uniqueness)
    - Automorphism group of a functor
    - Definition of GFset?
    - Show that there is a continuous embedding G into Perm(X)
    - Show Equivalence of categories between G-Fset and \hat{G}-Fset

3. Profinite completion of a group with universal property is Ghat, defintion of automorphism group of functor which is MulAut (NatTrans F F) where we put an instance of Mul on NatTrans F F.
